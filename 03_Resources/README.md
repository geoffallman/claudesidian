**Notes**: 
- The `People/` folder contains your personal context and relationship information for colleagues, clients, and external contacts - not general biographical information about notable figures (which would go in other topic folders).
- The `Organizations/` folder contains operational information about companies you work with - tech stacks, internal tools, processes, and organizational knowledge.

## Resource Development

### From Consumption to Creation
1. **Capture**: Save interesting content
2. **Process**: Extract key ideas
3. **Connect**: Link to existing notes
4. **Develop**: Build your own understanding
5. **Create**: Generate original insights

### Progressive Summarization

- Second pass: Bold the most important
- Third pass: Create summary at top
- Fourth pass: Extract to own note

## Claude Code Prompts

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
- Clear, descriptive titles
- Include key concepts in name
- Avoid dates (unless historical)
- Use consistent formatting

### Note Structure
```markdown
# Concept Name

## Summary
One paragraph overview

## Key Points
- Main idea 1
- Main idea 2
- Main idea 3

## Connections
- Related to: [[Other Concept]]
- Contrasts with: [[Different Idea]]
- Examples: [[Case Study]]

## Sources
- Original article/book/video
```

### Maintenance
- Review and update regularly
- Merge duplicate concepts
- Strengthen connections
- Delete what's no longer relevant

## Tips

- **Quality over quantity** - Better to deeply understand few concepts
- **Your words matter** - Rewrite in your own understanding
- **Links are gold** - Connections create value
- **Review regularly** - Unused knowledge fades
- **Share freely** - Teaching solidifies understanding

## Remember

Resources are your external brain. The value isn't in collecting, but in connecting and creating. Use Claude Code to help you see patterns and build understanding across your entire knowledge base.
