# Synthetic User Testing

## Project Overview
**Start Date**: 2025-10-03
**Target Completion**: 
**Status**: Active

## Objectives
- [ ] Build browser-based synthetic user testing system using Comet/Dia + Perplexity Spaces
- [ ] Create reusable persona library with @ mention integration
- [ ] Develop user journey testing workflows for real websites
- [ ] Validate AI browser testing accuracy vs. traditional usability testing
- [ ] Create framework for scaling synthetic testing across different user types
- [ ] Document implementation guide for UX teams

## Context
Synthetic user testing represents a paradigm shift in UX research, using AI-powered personas to simulate real user behavior at scale. This emerging field addresses critical challenges in traditional user research: high costs, logistical complexity, recruitment difficulties, and limited diversity in participant pools.

**Novel Approach**: Instead of abstract persona simulation, this project focuses on using AI-embedded browsers (Comet, Dia) to conduct actual website testing with synthetic personas. The concept: create detailed persona profiles in Perplexity Spaces, then reference them in AI browsers with @ mentions to execute real user journeys and tasks on live websites.

With 71% of researchers expecting synthetic responses to dominate data collection by 2025, this project explores practical browser-based implementation that bridges the gap between theoretical personas and actual user testing.

## Success Criteria
- Working Comet/Dia + Perplexity integration for persona-driven website testing
- Library of 10+ detailed personas with consistent @ mention functionality
- Validated user journey testing on 3+ different website types
- Comparison study showing correlation with real user testing results
- Scalable workflow that reduces testing time by 70%+ vs. traditional methods
- Implementation guide for UX teams to adopt browser-based synthetic testing

## Key Resources
**Research Papers:**
- "LLM Generated Persona is a Promise with a Catch" (March 2025)
- "Population-Aligned Persona Generation for LLM-based Social Simulation" (Sept 2024)

**AI Browser Tools:**
- Comet (AI-embedded browser with @ mention capabilities)
- Dia (alternative AI browser for comparison testing)
- Perplexity Spaces (for hosting persona libraries)

**Traditional Platforms (for comparison):**
- Synthetic Users (syntheticusers.com) - 85% accuracy claim
- Tracetest - State-of-the-art synthetic monitoring
- Nielsen Norman Group analysis on synthetic users

**AI Models for Persona Generation:**
- Claude Sonnet 4 (current generation - claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
- Latest GPT-4o models for persona creation and validation
- Browser-integrated AI for real-time user journey execution

## Progress Log
<!-- Claude Code will help maintain this -->

### 2025-10-03 - Project Initiated
- Set up project structure
- Completed comprehensive research on current synthetic user testing landscape
- Identified key platforms: Synthetic Users, Tracetest, and traditional UX tools
- Discovered 71% of researchers expect synthetic responses to dominate by 2025
- Found accuracy claims of 85% for replicating real survey responses (using 2024-era models)
- Advantage: Using current Claude Sonnet 4 and latest GPT models for superior capabilities
- Mapped key use cases: early-stage validation, accessibility testing, cross-cultural research

## Open Questions
- How effective is @ mention persona integration in maintaining consistent user behavior?
- Can AI browsers accurately simulate user friction points and confusion?
- What's the optimal level of detail for personas to be effective but not overly complex?
- How do we measure and validate that AI browser actions match real user behavior?
- Can this approach scale beyond simple journeys to complex multi-session user flows?
- What are the limitations of current AI browsers for realistic user simulation?
- How do we handle dynamic content and personalized experiences in testing?

## Next Actions
- [ ] Set up Perplexity Space for persona library
- [ ] Create 3-5 initial detailed personas as markdown files
- [ ] Test Comet browser integration with @ mention functionality
- [ ] Design simple user journey tests (e.g., e-commerce checkout, form completion)
- [ ] Run parallel tests: AI browser vs. real users on same journey
- [ ] Document workflow and optimize for scalability
- [ ] Test Dia browser as alternative/comparison tool
