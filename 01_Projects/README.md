# ðŸŽ¯ Projects

Active initiatives with specific outcomes and deadlines.

## Purpose

Projects are **time-bound efforts** with:
- Clear objectives and deliverables
- Defined start and end dates
- Specific success criteria
- Measurable outcomes

## What Belongs Here

### Good Projects
- "Q1 2024 Marketing Strategy" âœ“
- "Website Redesign" âœ“
- "Book Writing - AI & Creativity" âœ“
- "Conference Talk - BRXND NYC" âœ“

### Not Projects (These go in Areas)
- "Health" âœ— (ongoing, no end date)
- "Learning" âœ— (continuous activity)
- "Team Management" âœ— (ongoing responsibility)

## Project Structure

Each project should be organized as a **folder** containing:
```
Project_Name/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # Project overview and status
â”œâ”€â”€ research/          # Background materials, papers, references
â”œâ”€â”€ daily-progress/    # Log of work sessions
â”œâ”€â”€ drafts/           # Work in progress documents
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/           # Supporting files (images, PDFs, etc.)
â””â”€â”€ deliverables/     # Final outputs and completed work
```

**Note**: Always create a folder for each project, not just a single markdown file. This allows for better organization of multiple file types and project assets.

## Claude Code Workflows

### Starting a Project
```
Create a new project called [name] in 01_Projects.
Set it up as a folder with the standard subfolder structure.
I'm in thinking mode - help me define objectives.
```

### Project Research
```
I'm working on [project name].
Search my vault for relevant existing notes.
What connections exist to my other work?
```

### Daily Progress
```
Create a progress note for today in [project]/Daily_Progress.
Here's what I accomplished: [summary]
Questions that came up: [list]
```

### Project Status
```
Review all notes in [project folder].
What's the current status?
What are the key insights so far?
What's left to complete?
```

### Project Completion
```
Project [name] is complete.
Create a retrospective covering:
- Objectives vs outcomes
- Key learnings
- What to do differently next time
Then help me archive it properly.
```

## Project Lifecycle

1. **Initiation**: Define objectives, success criteria
2. **Research**: Gather relevant information
3. **Development**: Daily progress, iterative work
4. **Review**: Regular status checks
5. **Completion**: Final output, retrospective
6. **Archive**: Move to 04_Archive with summary

## Tips for Success

- **Start with clear objectives** - Vague projects never end
- **Use the template** - Consistency helps Claude Code help you
- **Log progress daily** - Even "no progress" is worth noting
- **Review weekly** - Keep projects on track
- **Complete or kill** - Don't let projects linger

## When to Archive

Move projects to `04_Archive/` when:
- All objectives are complete
- The project is cancelled
- It's been inactive for 30+ days
- It's transformed into an Area (ongoing)

Always create a summary note before archiving!
