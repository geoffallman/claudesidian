# Personas

This folder contains detailed user personas for synthetic testing.

## Structure
- Each persona should be a separate markdown file
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `tech-savvy-millennial.md`, `accessibility-focused-user.md`)
- Include demographics, goals, pain points, technical proficiency, and behavioral patterns

## For Perplexity Spaces Integration
- Personas here will be uploaded to Perplexity Spaces
- Use @ mentions in Comet/Dia browsers to reference specific personas
- Keep persona files focused and detailed enough for consistent AI behavior simulation
